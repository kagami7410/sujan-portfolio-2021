									<h2>About Light!</h2>
									<p>Getting enough sleep daily is crucial, however when an individual gets the suggested 7-8 hours of sleep, the effect of sleep inertia also known as morning grogginess can be present depending on environmental cues and the sleep phase upon awakening (Achermann, 1995).
										Studies shows that on average 49% of the time, individuals are woken up at the REM stage and 42% at the non rem stage and other 9% at the transitioning stage (Trotti, 2016).  Melatonin levels are highest during REM sleep.  (Rafael Luboshitzky, 1999). This is why some days we wake up feeling energised and some days feeling groggy. Therefore, almost everyone is affected by sleep inertia.</p>
									<hr />

									<p><span class="image left1"><img src="EN329/graph1.png" alt="" /></span>The project focuses on reducing the effect of morning grogginess by designing a product that utilises dawn simulator, artificially producing the natural light and visual appearance of the real sun to enhance the effect of dawn simulator and zeitgeber principle; Zeitgeber is any external or environmental cue that synchronizes an organism's biological rhythms, usually naturally occurring, for example transitioning of dawn during morning/evening.

										The importance of imitating the natural sun artificially  is because Humans tends to prefer natural substances over their synthetic counterparts. It is also proven that natural preference is also operative in the domain of light (Haans 2014). It was also evident in a psychological study, that the subjects in the study preferred indoor illumination that was perceived as more natural and the effect of light on subject was enhanced such as mood and energy levels. (Canazei, 2015)
										
										.<br>Studies show that exposure to the good quantities of morning light is essential for the proper function of the body’s internal clock. This can be helped by using a light to simulate the sun; gradually increasing light intensity following sunrise. Exposure to a dawn simulation light can help enhance atmosphere and cognitive performance lessening the effect of sleep inertia (Virginie Gabel, 2013). </br></p>

										<span><p>
											The optical design experiment was aimed to attain the effects of a strong and almost parallel light while lighting the diffuser for Rayleigh scattering effect. 
											The experiments were focused on the physical model of the phenomena that occur in the atmosphere and are designed to mimic morning sunlight conditions, both in directional spot sunlight effect and in diffused skylight components caused by Rayleigh scattering.

								<span><p>In the experiment, 20W led is compromised as a light source, spectrally very comparable to the visible wavelength of sunlight (CCT 5770 K). <br>
The aim of this experiment was to determine the focal length of the Fresnel lens to achieve the spot light effect of the sun entering indoor space from outside. The focal length was obtained to be 16cm, therefore setting a new constraint in design, of having depth of at least 16cm. Though the experiment was a somewhat successful, the refraction produced by the Fresnel lens caused rainbow effect around the edges of the spotlight; affecting the effect of the light to be less natural.

										<span><p>A light diffuser was made of watertight cavity; composed of transparent acrylic sheets and butyl rubber as a gasket. The cavity was then filled with colloid particle (soap) in a water.		</p></span>
										The use of diffuser allowed for scattering phenomenon to take place, where the blue light was almost completely diffused, whilst the red spectrum of light was almost completely transmitted. In such case, the two foundations of natural light (sun and sky) were recreated.

											<h3>Design for Manufacturing (DFM)</h3>
										<dd>
											<p>During design process, the parts of the final design was modelled through CAD which is compatible for creating mould through additive manufacturing such as 3d printing. The mould then can be used for injection moulding process to manufacture the parts. Injection moulding allows control for great surface finish improving to overall aesthetics of the finished product.</p>
											</dd>
										
										<h3>Design for Assembly (DFA)</h3>
										<dd>
											<p>
												The assembly for the parts can be assembled with ease and quickly as design provide self-aligning & self locating of screw holes and bolt head. The design also allows self fastening features. The connection components also allows for easy disassembly.</p></dd>
										<h3>Design for Reliability (DFR)</h3>
										<dd>
											<p><span class="image right"><img src="DEN329/p44.png" alt="" />
											<p>Mechanical property aren’t necessary for material selection as the product would not be exposed to extreme load or environment. Therefore, plastic material that can achieve good surface finish would make a good option, though recycled plastic is preferable to reduce the carbon foot print.</p></dd>
